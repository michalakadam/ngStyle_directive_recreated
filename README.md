# Attribute directive investigation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

## Goal

This project's goal is to increase understanding of Angular framework focusing on implementation of custom attribute directive and testing it's functionality.

## Project description

Angular's ngStyle attribute directive recreated. It dynamically modifies style of an HTML element. Includes support for units (eg. 'px', 'vh', '%').

## Literature

Angular guide on attribute directives can be found [here](https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives).

Great guide on testing custom attribute directive can be found [here](https://angular.io/guide/testing-attribute-directives).

My favorite summary of ngStyle and ngClass attribute directives functionality from [codecraft.tv](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/built-in-directives/ngstyle-and-ngclass/).
